# Overview

In this project I wanted to better use data strutures in C#. I wanted to make an actual music player but time did not allow for that. Instead I have a bunch of tests to make sure that I use my chosen data structures.

I used the following Data Strutures

* Queue
  * This was used to make a playlist of sorts where you could set a number of songs would play
* Linked List
  * I used this for the `MusicPlayerController`, A class which handles skipping, going back, and playing a song.
* Binary Search Tree
  * In this I took all the albums of Kayne west, shuffled a list of the titles, and then reorganized them in a search tree.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used JetBrains Rider to get this done. With no external libraries to get this done. 

# Useful Websites

I only used resources provided by the DS250 class and ChatGPT when I had debugging or questions about the way the data structures were organized.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- use a more consistent styling for the code
- create a music player
- use this as the logic for different functions
